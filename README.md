## Level 1: Meow

### Enumeration

The first step is understanding what information we currently have access too. We have been given an IP address of the machine, so we can start initiating a port scan using nmap.

First we can try to see if we can make contact with the machine with a ping request.

```
ping {ip address}
```
The results from the ping are:

```
└─$ ping 10.129.1.17
PING 10.129.1.17 (10.129.1.17) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.129.1.17: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=9.08 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.1.17: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=7.17 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.1.17: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=6.02 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.1.17: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=12.0 ms
--- 10.129.1.17 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 6.021/8.572/12.024/2.272 ms
```
As we can see, we made a connection with the host. 

Next, we can try using nmap to see if there are any ports that can be exploited.

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 3000 -sC -sV {ip address}
```

Where:

```
-p-: scans ALL ports
--min-rate <number>: Send packets no slower than <number> per second
-sC: equivalent to --script=default
-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
```
The results of nmap are:

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 3000 -sC -sV 10.129.1.17  
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-07-16 10:04 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.17

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 23.95 seconds
```
Our scan shows some interesting results. Port 23 is open, and reserved for the service telnet. Telnet is an insecure, outdated protocol that should not be used. A quote from (wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet]:


> Telnet, by default, does not encrypt any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often feasible to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login, password and whatever else is typed with a packet analyzer.

> Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted in the middle.

> Several vulnerabilities have been discovered over the years in commonly used Telnet daemons."


Thus, we can use this to our advantage to exploit this machine. 

We can start by trying to connect to the server using the telnet service.

```
telnet {ip address}
```
 
The results of using telnet are:

```
└─$ telnet 10.129.1.17
Trying 10.129.1.17...
Connected to 10.129.1.17.

```

Now we can try to use some commonly used credentials that may have been set up insecurely by that admin who set up the service. Some common login user names default to admin/admin or root/root. We can start by using these credntials to start with.

```
Meow login: admin
Password: 

Login incorrect
```

```

```
We can see here by using the username root, we were able to get root access to the system. 

Once infiltrated, we can now scan the directory for any important files.

```
root@Meow:~# ls

flag.txt  snap 
```

As we can see, we found out first flag in the main directory.

## Conclusions - Level 1 Meow

Using nmap, we were able to discover the host was running telnet on port 23. From there, we were able to get root access to service since the administrator of server had poorly configured the authentication of the system.
